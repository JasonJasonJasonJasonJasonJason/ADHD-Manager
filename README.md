Start the ADHD Assistant with:

```bash
python adhd.py
```

The main window includes:

- Tasks  
- Reminders  
- Notes  
- Calendar  
- AI Summary  

All data is saved automatically into `data.json`.

## AI Summary (Local Ollama)

To use the AI Summary feature:

1. Start the Ollama server:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

2. In the app, click **AI Summary**  
   The app sends your tasks/notes to the local model (`gemma3:4b`) and displays a generated summary.

---

## Running Automated Tests

The automated tests run **internally** (no mouse automation) using pytest.

Run all tests with:

```bash
pytest -s
```

You should see:

```
3 passed in X.XXs
```

Tests include:

- Adding a task  
- Deleting a task  
- Opening the AI summary popup

## Resetting the App

To reset all data:

1. Delete `data.json`
2. Run the app again  
   A fresh file will be created automatically.

Use the full path:

```
"C:\Users\<yourname>\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python313\Scripts\pytest.exe" -s
```

### Ollama model missing
Check installed models:
```bash
ollama list
```

If missing:
